## Short Description

In this game, you manage a bathouse. You need to serve random customers who come to the 
reception desk and wait in queue to be welcomed in. When at least one bath is ready, you can 
invite a customer in and he goes inside the available bath. After a specific amount of time spent 
bathing, the customer leaves and he is considered to be content with the service. After the cus
tomer gets out of the bath, you have to clean the bath and refill it with clean water to make it 
ready for the next customer.  

The catch is that you can only keep the business running if you have a maximum of 2 angry customers. A customer is considered angry when their patience runs out while waiting in the queue, 
causing them to leave without getting a bath.
